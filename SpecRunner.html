The Store
<pre>
* I want to add products to cart and get the total amount to be paid.
* I want to specify the quantity of product that is added to the cart.
* I want to get a receipt: “product name \t quantity x price = total price”
* I want to specify the quantity in kilograms for some items. I want to see the unit on the receipt after the quantity if applicable. The quantity should have 3 decimal places if unit exists, no decimal places otherwise.
* I want to see each product only once on the receipt even if i have added it multiple times. The quantitites must be added together.
* I want to see another item added automatically when I add specific items (e.g. bottle with drinks).
* I want to use an external service to get information about automatically added items. The external service returns name and price of the item that must be added.
* I want to specify that certain items cannot be purchased at some specific hours.
* I want to specify that certain products have a discount percentage that is deducted from the list price. I want to see the list price, discount percentage and  the discounted price on the receipt.
* I want to specify that any discount scheme is only available for a limited time period.
* I want to specify that the discount as a new price for some products (instead of percentage).
* I want to specify the discount as a promotion - get 3 for the price of 2. I want to see the applied discount on the receipt.
* I want to apply a discount as a percentage to the whole cart. The discount does not apply to items that have already a discount applied. The receipt must only show the discount amount.
* I want to specify that a discount of a certain amount is applied when two specific products are purchased together.
* I want to specify that a discount is only available on specific hours of the day.
* I want to specify that certain items require that the buyer must be of specific age. The exact birthday of the customer must be used to calculate availability.
